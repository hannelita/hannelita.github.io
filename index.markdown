Hi! Welcome to this page; make yourself at home!

I am currently working at Nasdaq as a Lead Software Engineer (focusing on software architecture). 

I am very much passionate about Programming Languages, program verification and research related to this field. Unfortunately, I've been away from these for a while, since it's hard to get into these topics in a regular SEng industry job. But I am very much interested in the subject and I'm always open to chat about it! Do you also like these topics? Let's have some coffee or tea and and talk about PL!

A while back, I was working at Intel, designing and maintaining [tools](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c) for [p4](https://opennetworking.org/p4/) programs. I was also a part-time faculty at [Dawson College](https://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/computer-science-technology/), where I shared my passion for programming. I do enjoy teaching and compilers.

Take a look at my [CV]({{ site.url }}/download/HanneliCVwithprojects-dld.pdf) for more information.

I completed my graduate studies in computer science at McGill University. These were not the happiest days of my life, but I fell in love with PL. I still find time to fulfill my interests about a pleasant formalization for hardware + software. I am a big fan of proof assistants and dependent types. Check [this page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/academic) for more information. 

I also supported multiple [SIGPLAN](https://www.sigplan.org/) [conferences](https://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/) as a volunteer and as a member of the organizing committee of POPL, ICFP, PLDI. But almost none cares about that.


In the past, I was a very enthusiastic software developer. I still am! I used to do a lot of talks and contributed to a few open source projects. You can check out some of these records [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/past).

And as a human being, I also have some hobbies! They are listed [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/hobbies).

Some folks told me they visited my website hoping to find a section "how to pronounce my name". If you are curious, here it goes: the stressed syllable is the first one; proceed with the standard EN pronunciation and you'll get a very acceptable result :) . However, in my native language, the "H" has no sound. 

Have fun! <3
