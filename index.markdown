Hi! Welcome to this page!

I am an MSc student in computer science at McGill University. Are you here to get info about my previous and current research? Check [this page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/academic) or take a look at my [CV]({{ site.url }}/download/HanneliCVwithprojects-dld.pdf).

In the past, I was a very enthusiastic software developer. I still am! I used to do a lot of talks and contributed to a few open source projects. You can check out some of these records [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/past).

And as a human being, I also have some hobbies! They are listed [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/hobbies).

Have fun! <3
