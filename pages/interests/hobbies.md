I eventually enjoy non-coding/non-math topics, such as Pok√©mon, Lego, figure skating, and books. In the past, I also enjoyed traveling and I was lucky enough to visit multiple countries. Which made me really interested in learning new (human) languages, either by fun or by necessity. I'm constantly looking for friends to practice French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Italian, Portuguese. If you are patient, maybe you can teach me your native language! =)
