I contributed to multiple OSS projects in the past, including:

#### [Neo4j Doc Manager](https://github.com/hannelita/neo4j_doc_manager/)
  Neo4j Doc Manager takes MongoDB documents and makes it easy to query them for relationships by making them available in a Neo4j graph structure

#### [Neo4j Cassandra Connector](https://github.com/hannelita/neo4j-cassandra-connector)
  The main goal of this project is to import a specific Tracks dataset that is in a Cassandra to a graph structure in Neo4j.
