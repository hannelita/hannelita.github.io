I've been helping to organise the following meetups in São Paulo, Brazil:

#### [Neo4j Users](https://www.meetup.com/graphdb-sp/)
Neo4j São Paulo user group, created in 2012. I've supported the group from 2014 to 2017, where I had the chance to organize several events and give multiple talks.


#### [Cassandra Users](https://www.meetup.com/Sao-Paulo-Cassandra-Users/)
Also created in 2012. I've supported the group from 2014 to 2017, where I had the chance to organize several events and give multiple talks and even lectures :)

#### [Rust Users](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Sao-Paulo-Meetup/)
I helped to create the group in 2015, and helped actively until the end of 2017. I gave the initial talks in this group, when I was a total newbie in Rust. Fun times! 
      
#### [SP Science](https://www.meetup.com/SP-Math-Physics-Science-Meetup/)
I helped to create the group in 2015, but sadly I had to leave my duties in 2017 and this community came to an end.
