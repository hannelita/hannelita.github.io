In recent times, I've been working with OCaml and with the [LearnOCaml platform](https://github.com/teaching-the-art-of-fp/learn-ocaml). You can check my recent poster at SIGCSE'21 [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408877.3439579)

In the past, I also did research in an intersection of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science! More specifically, I've been trying to convince engineers that there are alternatives to C and C++, in particular at domains like electromagnetic transient analysis. I started with Python (in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8627346)), and then [Haskell](https://github.com/hannelita/haskell-etrp-doc/blob/master/Report.pdf).
